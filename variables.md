## Step 7 : Providing values for Variables

1. Till now, we only used variables without hardcoding any values to resources.
2. Create two new files with name variables.tf for declaring variables and terrafrom.vars.tf for assigning values to variables declared, Copy the [variables.tf](https://github.com/mathesh-me/two-tier-architecture-aws-using-terraform/blob/main/Two%20tier%20architecture%20in%20AWS%20using%20terraform/variables.tf) for declaring variables and [terraform.tfvars](https://github.com/mathesh-me/two-tier-architecture-aws-using-terraform/blob/main/Two%20tier%20architecture%20in%20AWS%20using%20terraform/terraform.tfvars) file from my repository . Don't forget to customize `terraform.tfvars` according to your requirements.
3. Now , additionally create a new file with name secret.tfvars for providing values for DB useranme and DB password like this [file](https://github.com/mathesh-me/two-tier-architecture-aws-using-terraform/blob/main/Two%20tier%20architecture%20in%20AWS%20using%20terraform/secret.tfvars)
